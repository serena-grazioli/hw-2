# Homework 02
## Practicing the Reproducible Workflow

> **A note on AI tools:** Yes, ChatGPT, Claude, and similar tools can solve every exercise in this homework in seconds. Please don't let them. The point of this assignment is not the output — it is the practice. Use AI the smart way: to understand what a function does, to explain an error message, or to check your reasoning. Don't use it to generate answers you then copy in. That helps no one, least of all you.

### Goal

Practice the complete workflow independently:

> Clone → Edit → Render → Stage → Commit → Push

This assignment is about learning the **process**, not producing sophisticated analysis.

---

## 🔁 Important: Git + Render Workflow Throughout the Assignment

You should practice both **version control** *and* **rendering** continuously while working.

### Render frequently

- Render your document whenever you make changes.
- Check whether:
  - The document compiles without errors.
  - The output looks as expected.
  - Code results update correctly.
- Treat rendering as a way to **test your analysis**.

Do **not** wait until the end to render.

---

### Version Control Requirements

- Do **not** complete everything and commit once at the end.
- Commit regularly as you make progress.
- Write short, informative commit messages.

You must make **at least three commits** with meaningful messages, for example:

1. Added YAML metadata  
2. Added markdown text  
3. Added code and figure  
4. Minor revision / formatting improvement  

(Three is the minimum — more is fine.)

---

# Exercise 1 – Clone and Open the Project

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the folder in **Positron**.
3. Confirm:
   - The file `hw02.qmd` is present.
   - Git is active (you can see changes in the Source Control panel).

✔️ When finished: You have the project open locally and Git is tracking changes.

---

# Exercise 2 – Add Metadata (YAML)

Edit the YAML header of `hw02.qmd`.

Your YAML should include:

- An output format (`pdf`)
- A title  
- Your name  
- A date    
- A table of contents

Keep it simple.

🔁 Render after editing the YAML to confirm it works.  
💡 Commit after completing this step.

---

# Exercise 3 – Writing in Markdown

Write one short paragraph, in your own words, explaining:

- What is Quarto?  
- What is Git?  
- What is GitHub?  

Include some basic markdown formatting (e.g., bold text, italics, or a list).

🔁 Render to see how your markdown appears in the output.  
💡 Commit after completing this step.

# Exercise 4 — Advanced Quarto

Enhance your document by adding an image and a table.

1. Include an image in your document.
2. Add an informative caption to the image.
3. Write one sentence in your text that refers to the image using a cross-reference.
4. Add a table of your choice.
5. Give the table an informative caption and refer to it in your text using a cross-reference.

🔁 Render your document to check that the image, table, captions, and cross-references appear correctly.

💡 Commit after completing this step.

# Exercise 5 — Reflection

At the end of your document, add a section titled:

## Reflection

Briefly answer:

> What did you find confusing or difficult while working with Quarto, Git/GitHub, or Positron? Was there anything about the workflow that you are still unsure about?

Be honest — this helps improve the course.

🔁 Render one final time to confirm everything compiles cleanly.  
💡 Make a final commit.

---

# Final Step – Push to GitHub

Push all commits to GitHub before the deadline.

Your repository must contain:

- `hw02.qmd`
- The rendered file (`.pdf`)
- At least three commits visible in the commit history

---

## Submission

No separate submission is required.

Your work is considered submitted if:

- All commits are pushed to GitHub  
- The repository is updated before the deadline 


## Feedback policy

> **A sample solution will be published after the due date and will be available to everyone, regardless of whether you opt in to AI feedback.**
> **Optional AI feedback:** If you would like to receive automated AI feedback on your submission, you can voluntarily opt in by adding a file named `license.md` to your repository. The file must contain the MIT License text provided below.
> If `license.md` is present, your submission may be processed by an AI system, which will compare your work with the sample solution and add a `FEEDBACK.pdf` to your repository.

> **This is completely optional.** If you do not add `license.md`, your submission will not be processed for AI feedback. You will still have access to the sample solution after the due date.

### `license.md`

To opt in to AI feedback, create a file named `license.md` in the root of your repository and add the following text:
